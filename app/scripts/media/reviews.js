  title: 'Eranga is an extraordinary music teacher and person',
  reviewer: 'Lacey Key',
  review: "Eranga is an extraordinary music teacher and person. I have had many voice teachers, and she has been the best I've had. She goes above and beyond with each of her students to make sure that they learn, improve, understand and grow in music. I had been singing for over 10 years when I met Eranga, and she was the first teacher that asked me if I knew what the words meant that I was singing. We worked on understanding what each word and note meant-and it took my singing from good to great. The tone and quality improved in my voice in a matter of months, along with the place in my heart from which I was singing. Being taught by Eranga has made all the difference in my love for voice, and Eranga is a teacher who not only teaches you music, but also about who you are, and helps you become the artist you want to be. Thank you!"

  title: "The Eranga Experience: I can't believe it's already been almost a year since",
  reviewer: 'Steven Darchiville',
  review: "The Eranga Experience: I can't believe it's already been almost a year since I have been vocal training with Eranga Goonetilleke. Straying far away from a learning environment, and being constantly enveloped in a 9 to 5 lifestyle, I knew it was time for a fresh reality and challenge. My love for singing led me to Eranga, who had worked previously with my sister. Her stern yet positive and inspiring teaching methodology has driven me to learn so much about my vocal potential; showing me a side of myself I never knew. Every lesson is an exciting new stepping stone to conquer With her guidance, I feel confident on my path. Looking forward to what the future holds in vocal training with Eranga! Thank You!",
